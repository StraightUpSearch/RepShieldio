# Frontend Component Standards

## Component Architecture
- Use shadcn/ui components as base building blocks
- Extend with custom variants using class-variance-authority
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind's mobile-first approach
- Structure: `components/ui/` for base, `components/` for feature components

## Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively; avoid custom CSS
- Follow mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Class naming: Use conditional classes with clsx/cn utility
- Never use @apply directive; prefer utility composition

## Form Handling
- Use React Hook Form for all form implementations
- Integrate with Zod for schema validation
- Implement proper error states and user feedback
- Use controlled components for form inputs

## Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback() for optimization
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
