# E2E Testing Standards

## Testing Strategy
- Write E2E tests with Playwright for critical user journeys
- Test user flows: registration → login → ticket creation → status tracking
- Mock external APIs (SendGrid, Reddit) in tests
- Use data-testid attributes for test selectors

## Test Organization
- Group tests by user journey, not by page
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- Test authentication flows thoroughly

## Best Practices
- Use page object model for complex workflows
- Implement proper test isolation
- Handle async operations correctly
- Test both happy path and error scenarios

## RepShield-Specific Flows
- User registration and email verification
- Ticket submission for Reddit URLs
- Admin ticket management
- Email notification delivery
