# ⚠️ MIGRATED TO MODERN PROJECT RULES

This project now uses the modern Cursor Project Rules system instead of the legacy `.cursorrules` format.

## 📁 New Rules Location
All rules have been migrated to: `.cursor/rules/`

## 📋 Available Rules
- `repshield-core.mdc` - Core development standards (always applied)
- `frontend-components.mdc` - React/UI component standards (auto-attached to frontend files)
- `backend-api.mdc` - Express/API development standards (auto-attached to server files)
- `testing-e2e.mdc` - Playwright E2E testing standards (auto-attached to test files)
- `reddit-integration.mdc` - Reddit API integration patterns (agent-requested)

## 🔄 How to Use
The new rules automatically apply based on:
- **File patterns**: Rules auto-attach to relevant files
- **Manual invocation**: Use `@ruleName` in chat
- **AI decision**: Agent-requested rules are included when relevant
